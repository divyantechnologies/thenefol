Take a small amount of the gentle cleanser in your palm. Add a few drops of water to create a rich lather. Massage the cleanser onto your wet face using circular motions, focusing on areas with makeup, dirt, or excess oil. Pay special attention to the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin). Continue massaging for 1-2 minutes to allow the active ingredients to work. Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water until all traces of cleanser are removed. Pat your face dry with a clean towel. This step removes surface impurities, excess oil, and prepares your skin for the next treatment. Step 2: Furbish Scrub - Apply the scrub on your damp, cleansed face. Take an appropriate amount (about the size of a coin) and gently massage in circular motions, avoiding the delicate eye area. Focus on areas with rough texture, blackheads, or dull skin. Use gentle pressure and continue massaging for 1-2 minutes to allow natural exfoliating ingredients to slough off dead skin cells. The gentle scrubbing action will improve blood circulation and reveal fresher skin underneath. Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water, ensuring all scrub particles are removed. Your skin should feel smoother and more refined. Step 3: Revitalizing Face Mask - Apply a generous, even layer of the face mask over your cleansed and exfoliated skin, avoiding the eye and lip areas. Use a brush or clean fingers for even application. The mask should form a thick layer that covers your entire face. Leave the mask on for 10-15 minutes, or until it starts to dry and feel tight. During this time, relax and let the detoxifying ingredients work their magic. The mask will draw out impurities from deep within your pores and absorb excess oil. Once dry, wet your hands and gently massage the mask in circular motions as you rinse it off with lukewarm water. Continue rinsing until all mask residue is removed. Pat your face dry. This final step provides deep pore purification and leaves your skin feeling refreshed, detoxified, and glowing. Use this complete routine 2-3 times per week for best results.","Introducing the Nefol Deep Clean Combo - your complete 3-step skincare solution for achieving deep-cleansed, exfoliated, and purified skin. This comprehensive skincare kit combines three essential products designed to work in perfect harmony: a gentle Face Cleanser, an effective Furbish Scrub, and a powerful Revitalizing Face Mask. Together, they create a professional-grade at-home treatment that targets multiple skin concerns simultaneously. The first step features our gentle yet effective Face Cleanser, specially formulated to remove all traces of dirt, makeup, oil, and environmental pollutants from your skin's surface. It contains natural cleansing agents that work without stripping your skin of its essential moisture, leaving your face feeling clean and refreshed. The cleanser prepares your skin for deeper treatment by opening up pores and removing surface-level impurities. The second step utilizes our Furbish Scrub, an innovative exfoliating formula enriched with natural ingredients like Aprajita (Blue Tea), Papaya Extract, Rice Powder, and Tapioca Starch. This scrub gently removes dead skin cells that accumulate on the surface of your skin, which can cause dullness, clogged pores, and uneven texture. Regular exfoliation reveals the fresh, radiant skin underneath and allows your other skincare products to penetrate more effectively. The fine scrubbing particles work gently to smooth rough patches, minimize the appearance of blackheads, and improve overall skin texture without causing irritation. The third and final step features our Revitalizing Face Mask, a detoxifying clay-based mask that draws out impurities from deep within your pores. This mask contains powerful ingredients like Aprajita (Blue Tea), Charcoal, Kaolin Clay, AHA & BHA that work together to absorb excess oil, tighten pores, and remove toxins from your skin. When applied, the mask creates a protective barrier that prevents moisture loss while simultaneously pulling out dirt, blackheads, and excess sebum. The result is deeply purified pores that look smaller and cleaner, reduced oiliness, and a brighter, more even complexion. This complete 3-step routine is perfect for all skin types, including acne-prone, dry, oily, combination, and normal skin. Regular use of this combo helps maintain clear, healthy-looking skin by preventing pore congestion, reducing the appearance of blackheads and whiteheads, controlling excess oil production, and promoting a more radiant, glowing complexion. The natural ingredients ensure that your skin receives gentle yet effective care without harsh chemicals. Whether you're dealing with daily grime, makeup residue, or stubborn blackheads, this comprehensive kit provides everything you need for a thorough deep-cleansing routine that leaves your skin feeling incredibly clean, smooth, and revitalized.",?

Remove any makeup, dirt, or previous skincare products using your preferred cleanser. Gently pat your face dry with a soft towel. Take a small amount of the Anytime Cream (approximately a pea-sized amount for your face and neck) and place it on your fingertips. Begin applying the cream evenly across your face, starting from the center and working outward. Use gentle, upward circular motions to massage the cream into your skin. Pay special attention to areas that need extra care, such as dry patches or fine lines. Extend the application to your neck area as well, using upward strokes. Continue massaging gently for 1-2 minutes to ensure the cream is fully absorbed. The cream should disappear into your skin without leaving a greasy residue. If using during the day, allow a few minutes for the cream to fully absorb before applying makeup or sunscreen. For nighttime use, apply as the final step of your skincare routine before going to bed. The tinted formula provides a subtle, natural glow that makes it perfect for daytime wear, while the nourishing ingredients work throughout the day or night to improve your skin's texture and appearance. For best results, use twice daily - once in the morning and once at night.

Enriched with powerful natural ingredients, this cream is more than just a cosmetic product - it's a complete skincare solution. Aprajita (Blue Tea) provides potent antioxidants that fight against free radicals, environmental damage, and premature aging. These antioxidants help protect your skin from daily stressors like pollution, UV rays, and oxidative damage that can lead to fine lines, wrinkles, and dullness. Yellow Dragon Fruit, a superfood ingredient, brings brightening properties that help even out skin tone, reduce the appearance of dark spots, and revitalize tired-looking skin. Its natural vitamins and minerals nourish the skin while promoting a healthy, radiant glow. Saffron, known as one of the most precious skincare ingredients, works to improve overall complexion by reducing pigmentation, brightening the skin, and adding a natural warmth to your tone.

Kale Leaf provides essential nutrients, detoxifying properties, and nourishment that help maintain healthy, balanced skin. This cream is perfect for all skin types, whether you have dry skin that needs extra hydration, oily skin that requires lightweight formulas, combination skin that needs balanced care, or normal skin that simply wants to maintain its health and glow. The SPF protection ensures your skin is shielded from harmful UV rays during daytime use, while the tinted formula provides a natural coverage that reduces the need for additional makeup.

Remove all makeup, dirt, and impurities using your regular cleanser, then gently pat your face dry with a clean towel. For optimal results, use this serum after cleansing and toning (if you use a toner) but before applying moisturizer or cream. Take the serum bottle and dispense 3-4 drops into your palm. If you have a larger face or want extra hydration, you may use 5-6 drops. Using your fingertips, distribute the drops evenly across your face - on your forehead, cheeks, nose, chin, and neck. Avoid the delicate eye area. Now, gently massage the serum into your skin using upward and outward circular motions. Start from the center of your face and work your way outward. Use gentle pressure and continue massaging for 30-60 seconds to ensure complete absorption. Pay special attention to areas with fine lines, such as around the mouth, forehead, and under-eye area (but avoid direct contact with eyes). The serum should be fully absorbed within 1-2 minutes, leaving your skin feeling smooth and hydrated without any sticky or greasy residue. After the serum has been absorbed, wait 2-3 minutes before applying your next skincare product (such as moisturizer or sunscreen). This allows the active ingredients to penetrate deeply into your skin. For daytime use, apply in the morning after cleansing, followed by your moisturizer and sunscreen. For nighttime use, apply in the evening as part of your bedtime skincare routine, followed by your night cream. The concentrated formula works best when used consistently twice daily - once in the morning and once at night. Allow the serum to work overnight for maximum anti-aging benefits.","Discover the power of concentrated skincare with Nefol Face Serum - a potent, hydrating serum formulated with a unique blend of tea extracts specifically designed to target multiple signs of aging and restore your skin's youthful radiance. This lightweight, fast-absorbing serum delivers high-performance ingredients directly to your skin, providing intensive treatment that works at a cellular level to improve your skin's health, texture, and appearance. The serum combines the antioxidant power of four powerful tea extracts, each chosen for its specific skin-enhancing properties. Aprajita (Blue Tea) serves as the hero ingredient, providing exceptional antioxidant protection that neutralizes free radicals caused by environmental factors like pollution, UV exposure, and stress. These free radicals are responsible for premature aging, collagen breakdown, and skin damage. By combating these harmful molecules, Aprajita helps prevent and reverse signs of aging, keeping your skin looking younger for longer. Green Tea, renowned for its anti-aging properties, works to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by promoting collagen production and improving skin elasticity. It contains EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), a powerful compound that helps repair damaged skin cells and protects against UV-induced damage. Regular use helps smooth out existing fine lines and prevents new ones from forming. White Tea offers superior protection and revitalization properties. It's rich in antioxidants and works to protect your skin from environmental stressors while simultaneously revitalizing dull, tired-looking skin. White tea helps improve skin's natural defense mechanisms, making it more resilient to daily damage. Brahmi, an ancient Ayurvedic herb, is specifically included for its ability to improve skin elasticity. As we age, our skin loses its natural elasticity, leading to sagging and loss of firmness. Brahmi helps strengthen the skin's connective tissues, improving firmness and reducing the appearance of sagging. This concentrated serum is perfect for all skin types, including dry skin that needs extra hydration, mature skin that requires intensive anti-aging care, oily skin that benefits from lightweight formulas, and combination skin that needs balanced treatment. The fast-absorbing, non-greasy formula makes it suitable for use under makeup during the day or as part of your intensive nighttime routine. Regular use of this serum helps achieve visibly smoother, firmer, and more radiant skin with improved elasticity and reduced fine lines.",? Natural Care ? For All Types ?

Then, cleanse your face with your regular face wash to remove surface dirt and makeup. Pat your face dry, but keep it slightly damp - the scrub works best on moist skin as it allows for smoother application and better exfoliation. Take a generous amount of the Furbish Scrub (approximately the size of a small coin, or about a teaspoon) and place it in your palm or directly on your damp face. Begin applying the scrub evenly across your face, avoiding the delicate eye area and the sensitive skin around your lips. Once applied, start massaging the scrub onto your skin using gentle, circular motions with your fingertips. Use light to medium pressure - the scrub should feel like it's working but never painful or overly abrasive. Focus on areas that tend to have more texture, such as the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin), areas with visible blackheads, or parts of your face that feel rough or dull. Continue massaging in circular motions for 1-2 minutes. During this time, the natural exfoliating particles will gently slough off dead skin cells, and the active ingredients will penetrate your skin. You may feel a slight tingling sensation, which is normal and indicates the product is working. Avoid being too aggressive - gentle exfoliation is more effective and safer for your skin. After 1-2 minutes of massaging, rinse your face thoroughly with lukewarm water. Make sure to remove all scrub particles, as leaving any residue can cause irritation. Continue rinsing until your skin feels completely clean. Pat your face dry with a clean, soft towel - avoid rubbing, as your skin may be slightly sensitive after exfoliation. Follow up with your regular toner (if you use one), serum, and moisturizer to replenish hydration. Use this scrub 2-3 times per week, preferably in the evening, to allow your skin time to recover. Avoid using on days when you use other exfoliating treatments or face masks. If you have sensitive skin, start with once a week and gradually increase frequency based on how your skin responds.","Transform your skincare routine with Nefol Furbish Scrub - a gentle yet effective exfoliating scrub that works to reveal smoother, brighter, and more radiant skin by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, and improving overall skin texture. This carefully formulated scrub combines natural exfoliating agents with soothing ingredients to provide you with effective results without causing irritation or damage to your skin barrier. The scrub features a unique blend of four key ingredients, each selected for its specific exfoliating and skin-enhancing properties. Aprajita (Blue Tea) provides powerful antioxidant protection while simultaneously soothing the skin. As you exfoliate, your skin can become slightly sensitive, and the anti-inflammatory properties of Aprajita help calm and protect your skin during the process. This ensures that while you're removing dead cells, you're also nourishing and protecting the fresh skin underneath. Papaya Extract is the primary exfoliating agent, containing natural enzymes (papain) that gently break down dead skin cells and help dissolve surface impurities. Unlike harsh physical scrubs that can cause micro-tears, papaya enzymes provide a more gentle, chemical exfoliation that's suitable for regular use. This natural enzyme action also helps brighten the skin by removing pigmented dead cells, revealing a more even skin tone underneath. Rice Powder acts as a gentle physical exfoliant that provides mild scrubbing action to help remove surface debris, excess oil, and dead skin cells. The fine particles of rice powder are gentle enough not to cause irritation but effective enough to polish your skin and create a smooth canvas. Rice powder has been used in Asian beauty traditions for centuries for its ability to brighten and refine skin texture. Tapioca Starch serves multiple purposes - it helps create a smooth, creamy texture that makes the scrub easy to apply, provides additional gentle exfoliation, and most importantly, softens and conditions your skin during the exfoliation process. This ensures that after using the scrub, your skin feels soft and smooth rather than tight or dry. Regular use of this scrub helps unclog pores by removing the buildup of dead skin cells, oil, and dirt that can lead to blackheads and whiteheads. It improves skin texture by smoothing rough patches and uneven areas. The exfoliation process reveals fresher, newer skin cells, which naturally appear brighter and more radiant. It enhances the effectiveness of your other skincare products by removing the barrier of dead cells, allowing serums and moisturizers to penetrate more deeply. The scrub is suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin, when used appropriately. Those with acne-prone skin will benefit from its pore-clearing properties, while those with dull or rough skin will notice immediate improvement in texture and radiance.",? Natural Care ?

Make sure your hair is completely saturated from roots to ends - this helps the shampoo spread evenly and lather better. Avoid using hot water as it can strip your hair of natural oils and cause dryness. Take an appropriate amount of the Hair Lather Shampoo (about a coin-sized amount for short hair, or 2-3 times that for long hair) and apply it directly to your scalp at the roots. If you have very long hair, you may need more product. Using your fingertips (not your nails, as scratching can damage the scalp), begin massaging the shampoo into your scalp with gentle, circular motions. Start at the front of your scalp and work your way back, covering all areas including the crown, sides, and back of your head. Continue massaging for 2-3 minutes to allow the active ingredients to work and to stimulate blood circulation in your scalp. This massage action helps the shampoo penetrate deeply, cleanses the scalp thoroughly, and promotes better blood flow to hair follicles. As you massage, the shampoo will begin to lather. The rich lather will help lift dirt, oil, and product buildup from your scalp and hair. Once you have a good lather on your scalp, use your hands to work the lather down through the length of your hair, from roots to ends. Gently squeeze and massage the lather through your hair strands to ensure thorough cleansing. Continue working the lather through your hair for another minute, paying attention to areas that may have more product buildup or oil. After you've massaged thoroughly and worked the lather through all your hair, rinse your hair completely with lukewarm water. Make sure to rinse until the water runs clear and there's no shampoo residue left. Any leftover shampoo can cause buildup, dullness, or scalp irritation. For best results, you may repeat the process if your hair is very dirty or oily. After rinsing, gently squeeze excess water from your hair. Follow with your regular conditioner, focusing on the mid-lengths and ends of your hair. Use this shampoo regularly as part of your hair care routine - 2-3 times per week for normal hair, or more frequently if you have oily hair. For best results in controlling hair fall and promoting growth, use consistently as directed.","Experience the power of nature with Nefol Hair Lather Shampoo - a nourishing, therapeutic shampoo specifically formulated to combat hair fall, promote healthy hair growth, and maintain a clean, balanced scalp. This innovative shampoo goes beyond basic cleansing to provide targeted treatment for common hair concerns, making it an essential part of your daily hair care routine. The shampoo features a carefully selected blend of four powerful ingredients, each chosen for its specific role in promoting healthy hair and scalp. Aprajita (Blue Tea) brings exceptional antioxidant properties that protect your hair and scalp from environmental damage and free radicals. Just as antioxidants benefit your skin, they also protect your hair follicles from oxidative stress that can lead to hair damage and premature hair loss. The soothing properties of Aprajita also help calm irritated or inflamed scalp conditions, creating an optimal environment for healthy hair growth. Tea Tree oil is a natural purifying agent that deeply cleanses the scalp by removing excess oil, dirt, product buildup, and impurities that can clog hair follicles and impede growth. Its antimicrobial properties help maintain a clean, healthy scalp environment by controlling bacteria and fungi that can cause dandruff, itching, or other scalp issues. A clean scalp is the foundation of healthy hair, and Tea Tree ensures your scalp remains in optimal condition. Biotin, also known as Vitamin B7, is essential for hair health and growth. While the body naturally produces biotin, supplementing it topically helps strengthen hair follicles, improve hair thickness, and promote faster, healthier hair growth. Biotin helps improve the keratin infrastructure of your hair, making each strand stronger and less prone to breakage. It also nourishes the scalp, creating an environment conducive to new hair growth. Saw Palmetto is a clinically-studied ingredient known for its ability to reduce hair loss by blocking the production of DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a hormone that contributes to hair follicle miniaturization and hair loss. By inhibiting DHT, Saw Palmetto helps preserve existing hair follicles and prevent further hair loss, making it particularly beneficial for those experiencing pattern hair loss or excessive shedding. This gentle yet effective shampoo is suitable for all hair types - straight, wavy, curly, or coily. The rich, luxurious lather ensures thorough cleansing without stripping your hair of essential natural oils. Regular use helps reduce hair fall by strengthening hair from the roots, promotes new hair growth by maintaining healthy follicles, maintains a clean, balanced scalp free from buildup and impurities, and nourishes hair strands to prevent breakage and improve overall hair health. Whether you're dealing with excessive hair fall, slow growth, or simply want to maintain healthy, strong hair, this shampoo provides the comprehensive care your hair needs.",? Natural Care ?

Rinse thoroughly to ensure your hair is clean. Gently squeeze out excess water from your hair, but keep it damp - the mask works best on wet hair as it allows better penetration of the nourishing ingredients. You can also towel-dry your hair slightly, but don't make it completely dry. Take a generous amount of the Hair Mask (the amount depends on your hair length - for short hair, use about 2 tablespoons; for medium hair, use 3-4 tablespoons; for long or thick hair, you may need 5-6 tablespoons or more). Begin applying the mask to your hair, starting from the mid-lengths and working your way down to the ends. Avoid applying directly to the scalp at the roots, as this can make your hair look greasy. Focus on the areas that need the most care - typically the ends and any damaged or dry sections. Use your fingers or a wide-tooth comb to distribute the mask evenly through your hair strands. Make sure every section is well-coated with the mask. Once applied, gently comb through your hair to ensure even distribution and to detangle any knots. After the mask is evenly distributed, you can gather your hair and clip it up if desired, or simply leave it down. Leave the mask on for 5-10 minutes. For severely damaged or dry hair, you can leave it on for up to 15-20 minutes for deeper conditioning. You can cover your hair with a shower cap or wrap it in a warm towel to help the mask penetrate better and create a deep conditioning treatment. During this time, the rich, nourishing ingredients will deeply hydrate your hair, repair damage, and restore shine. After the recommended time has passed, rinse your hair thoroughly with lukewarm or cool water. Make sure to rinse until the water runs clear and all mask residue is removed. Cool water helps seal the hair cuticles, locking in the moisture and leaving your hair shinier and smoother. Gently squeeze out excess water and proceed with your regular styling routine, or let your hair air dry for best results. Use this mask once a week for normal to slightly dry hair, or 2-3 times a week if you have very dry, damaged, or chemically treated hair. For best results, use consistently as part of your weekly hair care routine.","Restore your hair's natural beauty with Nefol Hair Mask - a deeply nourishing, intensive conditioning treatment designed to repair damage, restore shine, and strengthen your hair from within. This luxurious hair mask goes beyond surface-level conditioning to provide deep, penetrating treatment that transforms dry, damaged, or dull hair into silky, soft, and healthy-looking strands. The mask features a powerful combination of four premium ingredients, each selected for its specific role in hair restoration and maintenance. Aprajita (Blue Tea) works to strengthen your hair from the roots to the tips by providing essential nutrients and antioxidants that protect hair follicles and strands. The strengthening properties help reduce breakage and split ends, making your hair more resilient to daily styling, environmental damage, and heat treatments. Stronger hair means less hair loss, reduced breakage, and longer, healthier-looking strands. Shea Butter is one of nature's most effective deep conditioning agents, rich in fatty acids and vitamins that penetrate deep into the hair shaft to restore moisture and elasticity. It works to repair damage caused by heat styling, chemical treatments, pollution, and UV exposure. The emollient properties of Shea Butter smooth the hair cuticle, reducing frizz and leaving your hair soft, manageable, and touchably smooth. It's particularly effective at treating dry, brittle, or damaged hair. Quinoa, a superfood ingredient, brings exceptional nourishing properties that help restore your hair's natural shine and luster. Rich in proteins, amino acids, and vitamins, Quinoa helps rebuild the hair's protein structure, filling in gaps and damage in the hair cuticle. This not only improves the appearance of your hair but also makes it stronger and more resistant to future damage. The result is hair that looks and feels healthier, with a natural, glossy shine that reflects light beautifully. Olive Squalane is a lightweight, non-greasy emollient that softens and nourishes your hair without weighing it down. Unlike heavy oils, Squalane absorbs quickly and provides hydration that lasts. It helps improve hair texture, making it easier to comb and style while reducing tangles and knots. The softening properties leave your hair feeling silky and smooth, and the nourishment helps prevent future damage and dryness. This comprehensive hair mask is perfect for all hair types, whether you have straight, wavy, curly, or coily hair. It's especially beneficial for those with dry, damaged, color-treated, or chemically processed hair that needs intensive repair and hydration. Regular use of this mask helps restore shine and luster to dull hair, strengthen hair strands to reduce breakage and split ends, deeply hydrate dry or damaged hair, improve hair texture and manageability, repair damage from heat styling and environmental factors, and maintain healthy-looking, soft, and silky hair. The mask works by penetrating the hair shaft to deliver intensive nourishment, while the rich formula coats each strand to protect and smooth the hair cuticle.

You can apply the oil before washing your hair or on dry hair for an overnight treatment. Part your hair into sections to ensure even application - this is especially important if you have thick or long hair. Take 10-15 ml (approximately 2-3 tablespoons) of the Hair Oil in your palm. You may need more if you have very long or thick hair. Warm the oil slightly by rubbing it between your palms - this helps with better absorption and creates a more pleasant experience. Begin applying the oil to your scalp, starting at the front and working your way back. Use your fingertips (not nails) to gently massage the oil into your scalp using circular motions. Apply gentle but firm pressure to stimulate blood circulation while distributing the oil. Work section by section, ensuring you cover your entire scalp - front, crown, sides, and back of your head. Spend 5-10 minutes massaging your scalp thoroughly. The massage action is crucial as it helps the oil penetrate deeper, stimulates hair follicles, improves blood circulation to the scalp, and promotes relaxation. Focus on areas where you experience more hair fall or where hair growth is slower. After thoroughly massaging your scalp, apply the remaining oil (if any) to the length of your hair, focusing on the mid-lengths and ends, which tend to be drier. Gently work the oil through your hair strands using your fingers, ensuring even distribution. Once applied, you can comb your hair gently with a wide-tooth comb to distribute the oil more evenly and detangle your hair. For regular treatment, leave the oil on for at least 30 minutes before washing. For intensive treatment, you can leave it on overnight - simply tie your hair in a loose bun or braid and cover with a shower cap or old towel to protect your pillow. In the morning or after the recommended time, wash your hair thoroughly with a gentle shampoo. You may need to shampoo twice to completely remove the oil. Follow with conditioner as usual. Use this oil 2-3 times per week for best results. Consistency is key for seeing improvement in hair fall, growth, and overall hair health.","Unlock the secrets of Ayurvedic hair care with Nefol Hair Oil - a powerful, multi-nutrient hair oil blend that combines the best of traditional Indian hair care wisdom with modern formulation techniques. This comprehensive hair treatment oil is designed to address multiple hair concerns simultaneously, providing your hair and scalp with the nourishment they need for optimal health and growth. The oil features a synergistic blend of six premium natural oils, each carefully selected for its unique properties and benefits. Sesame Oil is rich in vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids that strengthen hair roots and follicles. It penetrates deep into the scalp to nourish hair from the roots, improving overall hair strength and reducing breakage. The warming properties of sesame oil also help improve blood circulation in the scalp, creating an environment conducive to healthy hair growth. Amla (Indian Gooseberry) is one of the most revered ingredients in Ayurvedic hair care, known for its ability to reduce hair fall significantly. Rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants, Amla strengthens hair follicles, prevents premature graying, and promotes new hair growth. It also helps maintain the natural pH balance of the scalp and prevents dandruff, which can contribute to hair loss. Flaxseed Oil provides essential omega-3 fatty acids and proteins that deeply nourish both the scalp and hair strands. These nutrients are essential for healthy hair growth and help improve hair texture, making it softer and more manageable. Flaxseed oil also helps reduce scalp inflammation and irritation, creating a healthy environment for hair follicles to thrive. Coconut Oil is a powerhouse of fatty acids that add shine, luster, and softness to your hair. It penetrates the hair shaft better than most oils, providing deep conditioning that prevents protein loss from hair. The antimicrobial properties also help maintain a healthy scalp by preventing fungal and bacterial infections. Coconut oil leaves your hair looking shiny, feeling soft, and protected from environmental damage. Mustard Oil acts as a natural stimulant for the scalp, improving blood circulation when massaged in. Better blood flow means more nutrients reach the hair follicles, promoting faster and healthier hair growth. Mustard oil also has warming properties that help open up hair follicles, allowing better absorption of other beneficial ingredients in the blend. Argan Oil, often called 'liquid gold,' is rich in Vitamin E and fatty acids that restore hair elasticity and prevent breakage. It's particularly effective at repairing damaged, dry, or chemically treated hair. Argan oil also helps reduce frizz, adds shine, and makes hair more manageable. This comprehensive blend works together to nourish your hair roots, strengthening them from within to reduce hair fall and breakage. The oils penetrate deep into the scalp to provide essential nutrients that promote healthy hair growth and improve the overall health of your hair follicles. Regular use helps reduce hair fall by strengthening roots and follicles, promotes new hair growth by improving scalp health and blood circulation, nourishes hair strands to prevent dryness and breakage, adds natural shine and luster to dull hair, improves scalp health by preventing dandruff and irritation, and restores hair elasticity to reduce breakage and split ends. Suitable for all hair types, this oil is especially beneficial for those experiencing excessive hair fall, slow hair growth, dry or damaged hair, or those simply wanting to maintain healthy, strong hair.",?

Remove all makeup, dirt, and impurities using your preferred cleanser, then gently pat your face and neck dry with a clean towel. If you use a toner or serum, apply those first and wait a few minutes for them to absorb before applying the moisturizer. Take an appropriate amount of the Hydrating Moisturizer (about a pea-sized amount for your face, and a bit more for your neck). Place the cream on your fingertips or palm. Start applying the moisturizer evenly across your face, beginning from the center and working outward. Use gentle, upward circular motions to massage the cream into your skin. Begin with your cheeks, then move to your forehead, nose, chin, and finally your neck. Use upward strokes when applying to your neck to help prevent sagging. Continue massaging gently for 1-2 minutes, ensuring the cream is fully absorbed into your skin. The lightweight formula should absorb quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. Pay extra attention to areas that tend to be drier, such as your cheeks or areas around your mouth, applying a bit more product if needed. For morning use, allow a few minutes for the moisturizer to fully absorb before applying sunscreen (if not included) or makeup. The non-greasy formula makes it perfect for use under makeup. For nighttime use, apply as the final step of your skincare routine before going to bed, allowing the nourishing ingredients to work overnight.

This advanced moisturizer is formulated with a unique blend of natural ingredients that work together to keep your skin smooth, supple, and radiant throughout the day and night. The moisturizer combines three potent natural ingredients, each chosen for its specific skin-enhancing properties. Aprajita (Blue Tea) provides exceptional antioxidant protection and anti-aging benefits. Antioxidants are crucial for fighting free radicals - unstable molecules caused by environmental factors like pollution, UV radiation, and stress that damage skin cells and accelerate the aging process. By neutralizing these free radicals, Aprajita helps prevent premature aging, fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots. The anti-aging properties work at a cellular level to maintain your skin's youthful appearance and elasticity. Blueberry is a superfruit rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that provides exceptional hydration and nourishment. The natural sugars in blueberries help attract and retain moisture in your skin, providing long-lasting hydration that keeps your skin plump and supple. Blueberries are also rich in Vitamin C, which helps brighten the skin and promote collagen production - essential for maintaining skin firmness and elasticity. The nourishing properties help maintain your skin's natural moisture barrier, preventing water loss and keeping your skin healthy. Juniper Berry brings soothing and balancing properties that help maintain your skin's natural equilibrium. It's particularly beneficial for calming irritated or sensitive skin and helps regulate oil production, making it suitable for both dry and oily skin types. The balancing properties ensure your skin maintains optimal hydration without becoming too oily or too dry. Juniper Berry also has mild astringent properties that help tighten pores and improve skin texture. This lightweight, fast-absorbing formula is specifically designed to provide intense hydration without the heavy, greasy feel of traditional moisturizers. The non-comedogenic formula won't clog pores, making it suitable for all skin types, including oily and acne-prone skin. The quick absorption means you can apply makeup immediately after without waiting or experiencing pilling. Regular use of this moisturizer provides deep, long-lasting hydration that keeps your skin plump and supple throughout the day. It helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by maintaining optimal hydration levels and providing anti-aging antioxidants. The formula improves skin texture and smoothness, leaving your skin feeling soft and touchable. It enhances your skin's natural radiance by maintaining a healthy moisture balance and delivering essential nutrients. The lightweight formula is perfect for daily use and won't interfere with your makeup application or feel heavy on your skin. Whether you have dry skin that needs extra hydration, combination skin that needs balanced care, or oily skin that requires lightweight formulas, this moisturizer adapts to your skin's needs while providing comprehensive hydration and anti-aging benefits.",?

Remove any heavy makeup with a makeup remover if needed. Take an appropriate amount of the Face Cleanser (about a coin-sized amount) and apply it to your wet face. Add a few drops of water to create a rich lather. Using your fingertips, massage the cleanser onto your face using gentle, circular motions. Focus on areas prone to acne, excess oil, or where you typically experience breakouts - particularly the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin). Continue massaging for 1-2 minutes to allow the cleansing ingredients to work on removing impurities, excess oil, and dead skin cells. The gentle formula will help unclog pores without over-drying your skin. Pay special attention to areas with active acne or blackheads, but be gentle to avoid irritation. Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water, ensuring all traces of cleanser are removed. Pat your face dry with a clean towel - avoid rubbing, as this can irritate acne-prone skin. This cleansing step removes surface impurities, excess oil, and prepares your skin for the next treatment by opening pores and creating a clean canvas. Step 2: Wine Lotion - After cleansing and patting your face dry, take an appropriate amount of the Wine Lotion (about 2-3 drops for your face and neck). Apply the lotion evenly across your cleansed face and neck using your fingertips. Start from the center of your face and work outward in gentle, upward circular motions. Avoid the delicate eye area. Focus on areas with acne, redness, or inflammation. Gently massage the lotion into your skin for 30-60 seconds to ensure complete absorption. The lotion should be fully absorbed within 1-2 minutes, leaving your skin feeling smooth and hydrated without any sticky residue. The Wine Lotion will help calm any inflammation, reduce redness, and provide additional anti-acne benefits. For best results, use this two-step routine twice daily - once in the morning and once at night. In the morning, follow with sunscreen before going out. At night, this can be your complete routine, or you can add a light moisturizer if your skin feels dry. Be consistent with this routine to see optimal results in managing acne and controlling oil production.","Discover the perfect solution for clear, healthy skin with the Nefol Acne Control Duo - a targeted two-step skincare system specifically designed for oily and acne-prone skin. This comprehensive acne care set combines a purifying Face Cleanser with a soothing Wine Lotion to provide complete treatment that addresses the root causes of acne while calming inflammation and preventing future breakouts. The first product in this duo is our specially formulated Face Cleanser, designed to thoroughly remove impurities, excess oil, dirt, and makeup that can clog pores and lead to acne formation. The cleanser features gentle yet effective cleansing agents that work to unclog pores without over-drying your skin - a crucial balance for acne-prone skin, as over-drying can actually trigger more oil production. The formula helps remove dead skin cells and surface debris that can mix with oil and bacteria to form acne. It prepares your skin for the next step by opening up pores and creating a clean foundation for the treatment lotion to penetrate effectively. The cleanser is mild enough for daily use, even on sensitive, acne-prone skin, helping to maintain clean, clear skin without causing irritation or excessive dryness. The second product is our Wine Lotion, a targeted treatment formulated with wine extracts and natural antioxidants that provide multiple benefits for acne-prone skin. Wine extracts contain natural acids and antioxidants that help calm inflammation and reduce the redness associated with active acne. These properties work to soothe irritated skin and speed up the healing process of existing breakouts. The lotion also helps control excess oil production by balancing your skin's natural sebum levels. By preventing excessive oiliness, it reduces the likelihood of pores becoming clogged and new acne forming. The anti-acne properties work to combat the bacteria that contribute to acne development, helping to prevent future breakouts while treating existing ones. Additionally, the soothing ingredients help reduce the appearance of redness and inflammation, making active breakouts less noticeable while they heal. This two-step system works synergistically - the cleanser removes the impurities and excess oil that can cause acne, while the Wine Lotion provides targeted treatment to calm inflammation, control oil production, and prevent future breakouts. Together, they create a comprehensive solution that addresses acne from multiple angles: prevention by keeping pores clean and controlling oil, treatment by calming inflammation and reducing redness, and maintenance by creating an optimal skin environment that discourages acne formation. Regular use of this duo helps achieve clearer, healthier-looking skin with reduced breakouts, controlled oil production, calmed inflammation and reduced redness, unclogged and refined pores, and an overall improvement in skin texture and appearance. This set is perfect for those struggling with oily skin, frequent breakouts, blackheads, whiteheads, or combination skin with an oily T-zone. The gentle formulas make them suitable for daily use, and with consistent application, you'll notice a significant improvement in your skin's clarity and health.",? Natural Care ? For All Types ?

Avoid using hot water as it can strip your skin of natural oils. If you're wearing makeup, consider removing it first with a makeup remover, though this cleanser can also remove light makeup. Take a small amount of the Face Cleanser (approximately the size of a coin or a small pea) and apply it to your wet palms. Add a few drops of water and rub your hands together to create a rich, foamy lather. Apply the lather to your wet face, starting from the center and working outward.

During this time, the active ingredients are working to remove dirt, oil, makeup, and impurities from your skin. Pay special attention to areas that tend to be oilier or have more buildup. Be gentle around the delicate eye area to avoid irritation. The gentle formula ensures thorough cleansing without being harsh on your skin. After massaging for 1-2 minutes, rinse your face thoroughly with lukewarm water. Make sure to remove all traces of the cleanser - continue rinsing until the water runs clear and your skin feels completely clean. You can splash water on your face several times or use a soft cloth to help remove the cleanser. Pat your face dry with a clean, soft towel - avoid rubbing, as this can cause irritation. Your skin should feel clean, fresh, and soft, not tight or dry. Follow with your regular skincare routine - toner (if you use one), serum, and moisturizer. Use this cleanser daily, twice a day - once in the morning to remove overnight oil and sweat, and once at night to remove the day's dirt, makeup, and pollution. For best results, use consistently as part of your daily skincare routine.","Achieve clean, glowing skin every day with Nefol Face Cleanser - a gentle yet effective daily cleanser specifically formulated with Blue Tea and powerful natural ingredients to provide thorough cleansing while brightening and rejuvenating your skin. This versatile cleanser is perfect for daily use and works beautifully for all skin types, providing deep cleaning without stripping your skin of essential moisture. The cleanser features a unique blend of four potent natural ingredients, each selected for its specific skin-enhancing properties. Aprajita (Blue Tea) serves as the hero ingredient, providing exceptional antioxidant protection that fights against free radicals and environmental damage. These antioxidants help prevent premature aging by protecting your skin cells from oxidative stress. The anti-aging properties work continuously to maintain your skin's youthful appearance, while the soothing properties ensure that even with daily use, your skin remains calm and comfortable. The gentle nature of Blue Tea makes this cleanser suitable for sensitive skin while still providing effective cleansing. Kakadu Plum, known as one of the richest natural sources of Vitamin C, brings powerful brightening properties that help even out skin tone and reduce the appearance of dark spots and pigmentation. Vitamin C is essential for collagen production, which helps maintain skin firmness and elasticity. The brightening properties work over time to reveal a more radiant, even-toned complexion. Additionally, Kakadu Plum provides protection against environmental damage, helping your skin resist the effects of pollution and UV exposure. Yuja (Yuzu) is a citrus fruit rich in antioxidants and vitamins that works to revitalize tired-looking skin and provide natural toning effects. The revitalizing properties help refresh your skin, making it look more awake and energized. Yuja also helps improve skin texture and provides a natural glow. The toning properties help refine pores and improve overall skin appearance. Vitamin C & B5 work together to provide comprehensive skin benefits. Vitamin C offers additional brightening and antioxidant protection, while Vitamin B5 (Panthenol) is a powerful humectant that attracts and retains moisture in your skin. This ensures that even as the cleanser removes impurities, it also helps maintain your skin's hydration levels. Vitamin B5 also soothes and softens the skin, leaving it feeling smooth and comfortable after cleansing. This gentle formula is designed to remove all traces of dirt, oil, makeup, and environmental pollutants without over-drying your skin or disrupting its natural pH balance. The cleanser creates a rich, luxurious lather that makes the cleansing experience pleasant while ensuring thorough removal of impurities. Unlike harsh cleansers that can leave your skin feeling tight and dry, this formula maintains your skin's natural moisture barrier while providing effective cleansing. Regular use of this cleanser helps remove surface impurities, excess oil, and makeup that can clog pores and lead to breakouts. It prepares your skin for better absorption of subsequent skincare products by creating a clean canvas. The brightening ingredients work over time to improve skin tone and radiance. It maintains optimal skin hydration, preventing the dryness that can come from over-cleansing.

Pat your face dry with a clean towel, but ensure your skin is completely clean before applying the mask. Take an appropriate amount of the Revitalizing Face Mask (about 1-2 tablespoons, depending on your face size). You can use a clean brush, spatula, or your clean fingertips to apply the mask. Start applying a thin, even layer of the mask across your entire face, beginning from your forehead and working downward. Cover your forehead, cheeks, nose, chin, and the area around your mouth. Avoid applying the mask too close to your eyes, lips, or the delicate skin around them. The layer should be thin enough that you can still see your skin color through it in some places, but thick enough to form a continuous film. Once applied evenly, you can use your fingers or a brush to smooth out any uneven areas. As the mask dries, you'll notice it beginning to feel tight on your skin - this is normal and indicates that the mask is working. Leave the mask on for 10-15 minutes, or until it feels completely dry and tight. For very oily skin, you can leave it on for up to 15-20 minutes. During this time, avoid moving your facial muscles too much to prevent cracking. You can use this time to relax. When the time is up, wet your hands with lukewarm water and begin gently massaging the mask in circular motions as you rinse it off. The gentle massaging action helps with additional exfoliation. Continue rinsing with lukewarm water until all traces of the mask are completely removed. Make sure to rinse thoroughly, especially around your hairline and jawline where mask residue can accumulate. Pat your face dry with a clean, soft towel. After using the mask, follow up with your regular toner (if you use one), serum, and moisturizer to replenish hydration. Your skin should feel clean, refreshed, and noticeably smoother. Use this mask 1-2 times per week for best results. If you have sensitive skin, start with once a week and gradually increase frequency. Avoid using on days when you use other exfoliating treatments to prevent over-exfoliation.","Experience the ultimate deep-cleansing treatment with Nefol Revitalizing Face Mask - a powerful detoxifying clay mask designed to purify your pores, remove excess oil, and revive dull, tired-looking skin. This weekly treatment mask combines the best of natural and scientific ingredients to provide intensive pore purification and skin renewal that leaves your complexion looking refreshed, clear, and glowing. The mask features a powerful combination of four key ingredients, each selected for its specific purifying and skin-enhancing properties. Aprajita (Blue Tea) provides powerful antioxidant protection while simultaneously brightening and calming your skin. As the mask works to draw out impurities, the soothing properties of Blue Tea ensure your skin remains calm and comfortable throughout the treatment. The brightening properties help improve overall skin tone and radiance, revealing a more luminous complexion after use. Charcoal is one of nature's most effective detoxifying agents, known for its exceptional ability to absorb and remove impurities. The activated charcoal in this mask acts like a magnet, drawing out dirt, oil, blackheads, toxins, and environmental pollutants from deep within your pores. This deep cleansing action helps unclog pores, prevent breakouts, and remove buildup that regular cleansing cannot reach. The charcoal also helps control excess oil production, making it particularly beneficial for oily and combination skin types. Kaolin Clay is a gentle, natural clay that provides excellent oil absorption properties. It works by absorbing excess sebum from your skin's surface and from within your pores, helping to balance oil production and reduce shine. Unlike some harsh clays, Kaolin is gentle enough for regular use and helps improve skin texture without causing excessive dryness. It also helps tighten pores temporarily, giving your skin a smoother, more refined appearance. AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acids) and BHA (Beta Hydroxy Acids) provide gentle chemical exfoliation that works alongside the physical cleansing of the clay. AHAs help remove dead skin cells from the surface, revealing fresher, brighter skin underneath. BHAs penetrate deeper into pores to remove buildup and unclog them. This dual exfoliating action ensures thorough removal of dead skin cells and impurities, leaving your skin smoother, clearer, and more radiant. Together, these ingredients create a comprehensive treatment that provides multiple benefits: deep pore purification by drawing out impurities from within your pores, excess oil absorption to balance sebum production and reduce shine, gentle exfoliation that removes dead skin cells and reveals fresh skin, detoxification that removes environmental toxins and pollutants, and skin brightening that improves overall tone and radiance. Regular use of this mask helps maintain clear, healthy-looking skin by preventing pore congestion, reducing the appearance of blackheads and whiteheads, controlling oil production throughout the day, improving skin texture and smoothness, and enhancing overall skin radiance. The mask is suitable for all skin types, but it's especially beneficial for those with oily skin, combination skin, acne-prone skin, or dull, congested skin that needs deep purification. With consistent weekly use, you'll notice clearer pores, reduced oiliness, improved skin texture, and a more radiant, healthy-looking complexion.",? Natural Care ? For All Types ?

Remove all makeup, dirt, and impurities using your preferred cleanser, then gently pat your face and neck dry with a clean towel. If you use a toner or serum in your routine, apply those first and wait a few minutes for them to absorb before applying the Wine Lotion. Take an appropriate amount of the Wine Lotion (about 2-3 drops for your face, and a bit more for your neck). You can dispense it into your palm or directly onto your fingertips. Begin applying the lotion evenly across your face, starting from the center and working outward in gentle, upward circular motions. Start with your cheeks, then move to your forehead, nose, and chin. Extend the application to your neck area as well, using upward strokes to help prevent sagging. Make sure to cover all areas evenly, but avoid the delicate eye area unless the product is specifically designed for eye use. Continue massaging gently for 30-60 seconds to ensure the lotion is fully absorbed into your skin. Use gentle, upward motions when massaging - this helps with product absorption and provides a subtle lifting effect. The lotion should be completely absorbed within 1-2 minutes, leaving your skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and supple without any sticky or greasy residue. For daytime use, allow a few minutes for the lotion to fully absorb before applying sunscreen (if needed) or makeup. The formula is lightweight enough to wear under makeup without causing pilling or interference. For nighttime use, apply as part of your evening skincare routine. The anti-aging ingredients will work overnight to repair and rejuvenate your skin while you sleep. You can use this lotion daily, both in the morning and at night, as part of your regular skincare routine. For best anti-aging results, use consistently to maintain optimal skin health and appearance. The daily application ensures your skin receives continuous protection and nourishment.","Transform your skincare routine with Nefol Wine Lotion - a luxurious anti-aging lotion enriched with wine extracts and powerful natural antioxidants that work together to combat signs of aging, brighten your complexion, and provide deep nourishment for soft, smooth, and radiant skin. This premium lotion combines the age-defying properties of wine with nature's most powerful skin-enhancing ingredients to create a comprehensive anti-aging solution. The lotion features a carefully selected blend of three powerful ingredients, each chosen for its specific anti-aging and skin-enhancing properties. Aprajita (Blue Tea) provides exceptional antioxidant protection that fights against free radicals - unstable molecules caused by environmental factors like pollution, UV radiation, stress, and lifestyle choices that damage skin cells and accelerate the aging process. By neutralizing these free radicals, Aprajita helps prevent premature aging, reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and protects your skin from environmental damage. The anti-aging properties work at a cellular level to maintain your skin's youthful appearance, elasticity, and firmness. Mulberry extract is rich in natural compounds that provide powerful brightening properties. It helps reduce the appearance of dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and uneven skin tone by inhibiting the production of melanin (the pigment responsible for dark spots). The brightening effects work over time to reveal a more even, luminous complexion. Mulberry also contains antioxidants that further protect your skin from aging, making it a dual-action ingredient for both prevention and correction of aging signs. Grapeseed oil is packed with antioxidants, particularly proanthocyanidins and resveratrol, which are known for their exceptional free radical-fighting abilities. These antioxidants provide superior protection against environmental damage and help maintain your skin's health and youthfulness. Grapeseed oil also nourishes your skin with essential fatty acids and vitamins that help maintain skin elasticity, improve texture, and provide deep hydration. The nourishing properties ensure your skin receives the essential nutrients it needs to stay healthy and resilient. Wine extracts, the star ingredient, contain resveratrol - a powerful antioxidant compound that has been extensively studied for its anti-aging properties. Resveratrol helps protect your skin from UV damage, reduces inflammation, and may help prevent the breakdown of collagen - the protein that keeps your skin firm and youthful. Wine extracts also contain natural acids that provide gentle exfoliation, helping to remove dead skin cells and reveal fresher, brighter skin underneath. Together, these ingredients create a comprehensive anti-aging formula that addresses multiple signs of aging: fine lines and wrinkles are reduced through antioxidant protection and collagen support, dark spots and pigmentation fade with brightening agents, skin firmness and elasticity improve with nourishing ingredients, complexion brightens for a more radiant appearance, and deep nourishment ensures optimal skin health. Regular use of this luxurious lotion helps combat visible signs of aging by providing continuous protection against environmental damage, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles through antioxidant action, brightening skin tone and reducing dark spots over time, improving skin texture and smoothness for a more refined appearance, and deeply nourishing your skin to maintain its health and resilience. The lightweight, fast-absorbing formula makes it suitable for daily use and perfect for all skin types. Whether you're looking to prevent early signs of aging or address existing concerns, this lotion provides the comprehensive care your skin needs to look and feel its best.",? Natural Care ?
